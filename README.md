# Android Loopback Oscilloscope
Based on the project M android app: https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm

Something breaks when you switch to a different app and come back to this one, so just have the music playing already when you launch the app. 

This was quickly hacked together for my LED Jacket project.
