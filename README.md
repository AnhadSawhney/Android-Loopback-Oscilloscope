# Android Loopback Oscilloscope
Based on the project M android app: https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm

This is a good starting point if you are making anything that requires visualizing the output audio stream on an android phone. The audio is captured in 16-bit PCM snippets from the master output channel. 

Something breaks when you switch to a different app and come back to this one, so just have the music playing already when you launch the app. 

This was quickly hacked together for my LED Jacket project.
